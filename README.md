# Elves

This is playground for various experiments, beliefs w.r.t OpenEBS. This repo 
helps OpenEBS in demonstrating &/ writing down these beliefs/thoughts.

Some of the experiments may mature into specific repositories of their own. While
many will find `elves` to be their only home.

Among other things `elves` will help new contributors to get a taste of OpenEBS 
in parts to better understand the whole. In other words, these contributors will
find OpenEBS design decisions, best practices, storage essentials, programming 
guidelines, etc in this repo.
